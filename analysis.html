        <h1>Part I: The Definitive Song Analysis Framework</h1>
        <p>This is a comprehensive deconstruction of the art, craft, and mechanics of Bullets and Goodbyes by Avalanche.</p>

        <h2>1) Metadata & Quick Facts</h2>
        <p>This section provides the song's vital statistics. These are the foundational choices that shape a listener's perception of time, energy, and emotion.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> "Bullets and Goodbyes"</li>
            <li><strong>Artist:</strong> Avalanche</li>
            <li><strong>Year:</strong>2025</li>
            <li><strong>Album / Release Context:</strong> N/A</li>
            <li><strong>Key & Mode:</strong> F Major. This is a critical and unconventional choice. A Major key (created by its 1st, 3rd, and 5th scale degrees) typically conveys happiness or stability. Its use here against a dark, outlaw narrative creates a powerful ironic prosody, suggesting the protagonist is defiant, confident, and even joyful, rather than scared or remorseful.</li>
            <li><strong>Tempo (BPM):</strong> 141 BPM. This is a fast, driving tempo that dictates a high-energy pulse. It sonically supports the themes of escape, pursuit, and adrenaline.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Signature:</strong> 4/4 (Common Time). This signature provides a stable, grounded, four-beat pulse, perfect for straightforward, hard-hitting rock and country storytelling.</li>
            <li><strong>Instrumentation Snapshot (Inferred):</strong> Driving acoustic and electric guitars, prominent and aggressive drums, pulsing bassline, and likely a slide guitar or harmonica for genre-specific texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> bullets-and-goodbyes.mp3 available on GitHub</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) Narrative Core</h2>
        <p>This section distills the song's story and central feeling into its most essential components.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One-Sentence Logline:</strong> Following the provided template, an outlaw protagonist [protagonist] cornered by the law in a desert town [specific situation] wants to escape [core desire] but faces his own fatalistic reputation and the imminent threat of a gunfight [obstacle].</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Truth:</strong> The single, recurring feeling is <strong>Defiant Fugitivity</strong>. The song is not about fear; it's an anthemic celebration of the outlaw identity, fueled by adrenaline and a cocky rejection of capture.</li>
            <li><strong>Lyrical Arc:</strong> The narrative tracks the evolution of the outlaw's mindset from confrontation to a statement of legend.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Setup:</strong> The first verse establishes the initial situation. The setting is a tense, "desert plain" standoff. The characters ("Sheriff's shadow") and the protagonist's aggressive nature ("I kicked the door") are clearly defined.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deepening:</strong> The pre-chorus deepens the protagonist's character, elevating him from a simple criminal to a mythical figure. He's fatalistic ("The crows are calling my name") but also views himself as unkillable, a legend who "ain't the kind that they dig in a grave".</li>
                    <li><strong>Payoff:</strong> The chorus delivers the song's ultimate realization. The "payoff" for the conflict ("rifles sing") is not death, but his escape ("I'll be long gone"). Verse 2 reinforces this, revealing this is not one event but his entire life's pattern ("One more town on my goodbye list").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) Form Map & Energy Curve</h2>
        <p>This maps the song's structure and its management of emotional intensity. The dynamic contrast between sections is what makes the chorus hit as a satisfying payoff.</p>
        <p><strong>Form (by sections):</strong> Intro &rarr; Verse 1 &rarr; Pre-Chorus &rarr; Chorus 1 &rarr; Verse 2 &rarr; Chorus 2 &rarr; Chorus 3 &rarr; Outro</p>

        <h2>6) Prosody Highlights</h2>
        <p>Prosody is the perfect marriage of lyrical meaning and musical feeling.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Word Stress vs. Beat Stress:</strong> The song is a masterclass in placing the "spotlight" on the correct "Meaning Words". The meter is a relentless, 8-syllable, 4-stress pattern. The "spotlights" consistently land on the key genre images: <strong>Dust</strong>, <strong>Whis</strong>-key, <strong>She</strong>-riff, <strong>kicked</strong>, <strong>crows</strong>, <strong>Moon</strong>-light, <strong>ri</strong>-fles, <strong>spurs</strong>, <strong>lead</strong>, and <strong>sad</strong>-dle. There are no "Big Moon" errors where a weak grammatical word is stressed.</li>
            <li><strong>Vowel Color:</strong> The chorus achieves its anthemic, sing-along quality by relying on long, open "O" vowel sounds: "<strong>long</strong> <strong>gone</strong>," "ring <strong>on</strong>," "<strong>song</strong>". These are easy to sing and sustain. The verses use harder, "closed" vowels and plosive consonants (<strong>kick</strong>ed, <strong>bright</strong>, <strong>twist</strong>, <strong>list</strong>) to create a punchy, percussive, and aggressive feel.</li>
            <li><strong>Line Shape (Front-Heavy Phrasing):</strong> The lines are consistently "front-loaded," a technique also known as <strong>Front-Heavy Phrasing</strong>. They deliver the key image or action on a strong downbeat at the start of the line ("<strong>Dust</strong> is rising," "<strong>Whis</strong>-key burns," "<strong>Tin</strong> star shining"). This phrasing feels "factual, declarative, and confident," creating a relentless forward momentum that perfectly matches the protagonist's attitude.</li>
            <li><strong>Rhyme Spectrum:</strong> The song exclusively uses <strong>Perfect Rhyme</strong> (e.g., plain/pain, floor/more, tonight/light). This is the "Most Stable" rhyme form, used to create feelings of "clarity, certainty, and a strong sense of resolution". This is a masterful prosody choice, as the protagonist's "unshakeable" confidence and certainty are perfectly mirrored by the stable, resolved feeling of the rhyme scheme.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7) Melody & Harmony Snapshot</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key/Mode Effect:</strong> The most crucial choice is the F Major key. For a narrative this dark, a minor key would be predictable. The major key creates brilliant ironic prosody. It sonically frames the protagonist's defiance as joy, his escape as a triumph, and the entire confrontation as a thrilling game. The key is the character's smirk.</li>
            <li><strong>Melodic Contour:</strong> (Inferred) The verses will use a rhythmic, lower, and more conversational melodic contour. The pre-chorus will climb in pitch to build tension. The chorus will feature the highest, most anthemic melody, peaking on "sing" and "on" before resolving down on the "long gone" hook.</li>
            <li><strong>Stable vs. Unstable Tones:</strong> The confident, declarative nature of the song means the melody will heavily favor <strong>stable tones</strong> (the 1st, 3rd, and 5th degrees of the F Major scale). The hook "I'll be long gone" will almost certainly resolve hard onto the <strong>tonic</strong> (F) and <strong>dominant</strong> (C) notes, making it feel like an unshakeable, musically-resolved statement of fact.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8) Groove, Arrangement & Vocal Delivery</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Groove:</strong> At 141 BPM, the groove is not a swing or a shuffle. It is a straight, driving, "four-on-the-floor" or train beat. The feel is relentless, fast, and built for a highway chase.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrangement:</strong> The arrangement will be a masterclass in dynamics.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Verse 1:</strong> Stripped back to bass, drums, and a rhythmic guitar to spotlight the lyric.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Chorus:</strong> Builds tension by adding a new layer, like a palm-muted electric guitar or a cymbal swell.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chorus:</strong> Explodes with full instrumentation: wide-panned electric guitars, open hi-hats, and a powerful, doubled vocal.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vocal Delivery:</strong> The performance must be a "confident smirk". It's a chest-voice dominant performance, full of grit and attitude. It's not angry or scared; it's cocky, defiant, and celebratory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9) Theme & Cultural Lens</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theme:</strong> The core themes are anti-establishment rebellion, rugged individualism, and the romantic myth of the American outlaw.</li>
            <li><strong>Setting/Objects (The "Canon" Method):</strong> The song's world is built from a perfect lexicon of "Outlaw" imagery. This world-building is a perfect example of the <strong>"Canon" Method,"</strong> or "Say More About Less". The core idea (the "canon") is the "American outlaw", and the song expands on this not by explaining it, but by providing a "cinematic universe" of specific, concrete images that prove it: "dust, desert plain, whiskey, bullet, sheriff, crows, moonlight, rifles, spurs, canyon, tin star, lead, saddle".</li>
            <li><strong>Genre Conventions:</strong> This song is a celebration, not a subversion, of Outlaw Country and Southern Rock conventions. It embraces the tropes of the genre (the lone wolf, the law, the escape) with 100% commitment, delivering exactly what the genre's audience craves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10) The X-Factor (The Moment of Genius)</h2>
        <p>The X-Factor is the ironic prosody of the F-Major key. Choosing an upbeat, celebratory, major key for a dark, "hunted man" narrative is a brilliant act of character-building. The entire song sounds like a fist-pumping rock anthem, while the lyrics describe a deadly confrontation. This disconnect is the point. It sonically communicates the protagonist's core belief: this chase isn't a tragedy; it's a thrilling, triumphant way to live.</p>

        <h2>11) The Rewrite Laboratory</h2>
        <p>This section explores alternatives to strengthen songwriting skills, adhering to the "Human Factor" principle.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improvable Line 1 (Identified):</strong> "Through the canyon echoes a dead man's song," (Line 11)
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> A strong image, but slightly ambiguous. Is the protagonist the "dead man"? Is it a warning? We can make it more active.</li>
                    <li><strong>Variations:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(Imagery Filter): "Through the canyon, wind sings a funeral song,"</li>
                            <li>(Attitude Filter): "That canyon's heard a thousand dead men's songs,"</li>
                            <li>(Metaphor Filter): "The canyon's throat sings a dead man's song,"</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Improvable Line 2 (Identified):</strong> "My saddle's waiting where the rivers twist," (Line 15)
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> A solid, functional line, but "rivers twist" is a common trope and lacks a sharp, specific image.</li>
                    <li><strong>Variations:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(Imagery Filter): "My saddle's cinched up where the cottonwoods twist,"</li>
                            <li>(Attitude Filter): "My saddle's waiting, don't care who's on my list,"</li>
                            <li>(Metaphor Filter): "My saddle's the only damn church that I've got,"</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Authenticity Test:</strong>
                <p>In both cases, the original lines are the strongest choice. This song's power comes from its lean, trope-perfect execution. It is not trying to be "poetic" or "clever". "Dead man's song" and "rivers twist" are classic, almost cliché, pieces of the genre's language. According to the "Human Factor" principle, a line that seems "simpler" is often the most effective because it feels more authentic and true to the character. The rewrites are trying too hard; the originals feel like they were pulled from a timeless, classic Western.</p>

        <h2>12) Two Summaries</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expert 5-Sentence Summary:</strong>
                <p>"Bullets and Goodbyes" is a masterclass in genre execution, powered by a 141 BPM, Southern-rock groove. Its primary genius lies in its ironic prosody, setting a dark, outlaw-fugitive narrative to an anthemic F-Major key, sonically capturing the protagonist's defiant, celebratory attitude. The lyricism is relentlessly tight, built on front-loaded, 8-syllable lines and perfect AABB rhyme schemes that land all "spotlights" on key genre nouns. The arrangement builds from a sparse verse to a full-band, open-vowel "long gone" hook, creating a perfect, high-energy payoff. It is a lean, commercially potent, and textbook example of "Outlaw Country" storytelling.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Plain-English (ELI5) Recap:</strong>
                <p>This is a fast, loud, and fun "getaway" song. It's about a cowboy/outlaw who is being chased by the sheriff, but instead of being scared, he's loving the thrill of it. The song sounds upbeat and happy, even though the lyrics are about a dangerous shootout, which shows the singer is a total rebel who feels most alive when he's on the run. It's a perfect song for driving fast with the windows down, built around the fist-pumping, sing-along line, "I'll be long gone".</p>

        <h3>4. The Lyricist's Toolbox</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Central Metaphor / Anchor Imagery:</strong> The "getaway" as the ultimate expression of freedom. The song is anchored by classic "Western" nouns: whiskey, bullet, sheriff, crows, rifles, spurs, tin star, lead, saddle.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Iconic Lines:</strong> "I ain't the kind that they dig in a grave," "Lead flies faster than their law is right," "I'll be long gone".</li>
            <li><strong>Rhyme Spectrum:</strong> Extremely stable and traditional. The verses and pre-chorus use AABB, CCDD perfect rhyme schemes. This creates a feeling of certainty and inevitability.</li>
            <li><strong>Rhythmic Phrasing Strategy:</strong> Relentless, front-loaded 8-syllable lines. The phrasing is percussive, confident, and lands directly on the beat, mirroring the driving 141 BPM groove.</li>

        <h3>6. Musical & Arrangement Direction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key / Mode / BPM / Time:</strong> F Major / 141 BPM / 4/4.</li>
            <li><strong>Genre & Style References:</strong> Cody Jinks ("Hippies and Cowboys"), Chris Stapleton ("Midnight Train to Memphis"), Steve Earle ("Copperhead Road").</li>
            <li><strong>Instrumentation Palette:</strong> Foundation: Drums, Bass, Rhythm Electric. Layers: Gritty Lead/Slide Guitar, layered acoustic guitars for texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrangement Architecture:</strong> Classic dynamic build: Sparse verse &rarr; building pre-chorus &rarr; explosive chorus. No bridge, just a relentless build to a double-chorus climax.</li>
            <li><strong>Melodic Goals:</strong> Verses are rhythmic and conversational. Chorus is a soaring, anthemic payoff that resolves with absolute confidence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. Performance & Production Vision</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vocal Style & Tone:</strong> A confident, gritty, Southern-rock "smirk." Must convey attitude and defiance, not anger or fear.</li>
            <li><strong>Vocal Dynamics by Section:</strong> Verses are tight, rhythmic, and almost spoken. Choruses are a full-chested, open-throated, celebratory roar.</li>
            <li><strong>Production Aesthetic:</strong> Punchy, dry, and powerful. A "live band in a room" feel. Not overly polished or slick.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix Priorities:</strong> Foreground: Lead Vocal, Snare Drum. Midground: Electric Guitars, Bass. Background: Acoustic texture, cymbals.</li>
            <li><strong>Signature Sonic Moments:</strong> The "wall of sound" of the full band hitting on beat 1 of the chorus. A potential slide guitar solo.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. Market Positioning & Competitive Landscape</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comparable Tracks:</strong> "Midnight Train to Memphis" (Chris Stapleton), "Copperhead Road" (Steve Earle), "Fast As You" (Dwight Yoakam).</li>
            <li><strong>Why It Works Commercially:</strong> It perfectly serves a core, underserved market: fans of high-energy, lyric-driven country rock. Its lean sub-3:00 runtime and high BPM make it ideal for playlists.</li>
            <li><strong>Differentiators:</strong> The relentless 141 BPM tempo is faster and more aggressive than most of its peers. The ironic F-Major key gives it a unique "happy rebel" sonic signature.</li>
            <li><strong>Brand/Sync Potential:</strong> High. Perfect for truck commercials (Ford, Ram), action/chase scenes in films, or video games (Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption).</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Part III: Songwriting Workbook (Emotional + Practical)</h1>
        <p>This is the lean, actionable workbook focused on the song's core emotional journey and craft.</p>

        <h4>1. Core Emotion & Truth</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What's the single emotional truth of this song?</strong> Defiant Fugitivity. It's the joy and confidence found in being a rebel.</li>
            <li><strong>Listener takeaway in one sentence:</strong> The listener should feel a rush of adrenaline and the unapologetic confidence to face any challenge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Narrative Arc (Story Shape)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> An outlaw is cornered by the sheriff in a tense, desert standoff.</li>
            <li><strong>Deepening:</strong> He reveals he's not afraid, but a fatalistic legend ("crows are calling," "ain't the kind... in a grave"), raising the stakes from a man to a myth.</li>
            <li><strong>Payoff:</strong> His "song" isn't a funeral dirge; it's the anthemic sound of his escape ("I'll be long gone"). The conflict is the payoff.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Lyric Tools</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key images or metaphors:</strong> Whiskey, bullet, sheriff's shadow, crows, moonlight, rifles, spurs, tin star, lead, saddle.</li>
            <li><strong>One memorable line (and why it hits):</strong> "I ain't the kind that they dig in a grave". It instantly elevates the character from a simple criminal to an unkillable, mythical figure.</li>
            <li><strong>Rhyme/phrasing style:</strong> Punchy, tight, and relentless. Uses simple, perfect AABB rhymes and a driving 8-syllable meter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Energy & Listener Journey</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Draw a simple curve (1-10) for each section:</strong><br>
                Verse 1 (4) &rarr; Pre-Chorus (6) &rarr; Chorus 1 (9) &rarr; Verse 2 (5) &rarr; Chorus 2 (9) &rarr; Chorus 3 (10) &rarr; Outro (4)</li>
            <li><strong>Where do you want the listener to feel the biggest lift?</strong><br>
                The explosive transition from the building pre-chorus ("...lost and the brave") into the full-band, high-energy chorus ("When the rifles sing...").</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>5. Performance & Delivery</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vocal/emotional style:</strong> A confident, rebellious "boast" or "roar." It's a smirk, not a scream.</li>
            <li><strong>Rhythm of delivery:</strong> Clipped, percussive, and driving. The vocal should land hard, right on top of the beat.</li>
            <li><strong>If you sang this, how would you physically feel in your body?</strong> Tense, coiled, and powerful. Chest out, chin up, ready to move.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>6. Rewrite Lab (Your Turn)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Take 1-2 lines you think could be stronger:</strong> "One last shot for the lost and the brave,"</li>
            <li><strong>Try 3 quick rewrites:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Imagery filter (make it more visual): "One last drink for the damned and the brave,"</li>
                    <li>Attitude filter (make it bolder): "One last sneer for the lost and the brave,"</li>
                    <li>Metaphor filter (turn it into a symbol): "One last verse for the lost and the brave,"</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Then ask: Does the original or your rewrite feel truer?</strong> The original is strongest. "Shot" is a perfect, classic double-entendre (a shot of whiskey / a gunshot) that fits the outlaw genre perfectly. It feels more human and authentic than the rewrites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>7. One-Line Takeaway</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Finish with this:</strong> "This song works because it makes the listener feel invincible by perfectly pairing a relentless, upbeat, major-key rock anthem with a classic, defiant outlaw story".</li>
        </ul>

        <hr style="margin: 40px 0; border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #e9ecef;">

        <h1>Part IV: The Expanded Lens: Production, Context, and Application</h1>
        <p>This module moves beyond the song's internal mechanics to analyze the production choices that shape its sound, its place in the lineage of "outlaw" music, and its visual representation.</p>

        <h4>13) Harmonic & Tonal Analysis</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Harmonic Vocabulary:</strong> The song's F-Major key choice is deliberate. The progression is likely built on the bedrock of rock and roll: the <strong>I</strong> chord (F Major), the <strong>IV</strong> chord (Bb Major), and the <strong>V</strong> chord (C Major). This I-IV-V movement is stable, optimistic, and rhythmically compelling. This use of a familiar, "celebratory" harmonic language makes the subversive, anti-authority lyrical content even more impactful.</li>
            <li><strong>Harmonic Tension:</strong> The Pre-Chorus ("The crows are calling...") likely introduces the relative <strong>vi</strong> chord (D minor). This momentary shift to a minor chord creates a brief pocket of harmonic tension and darkness, reflecting the fatalistic lyric before the chorus resolves powerfully back to the F-Major (I) chord for the "long gone" payoff. This is a classic technique to build tension before a massive musical and emotional release.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>14) Production Techniques & Sonic Aesthetic</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vocal Production:</strong> (Inferred) The verse vocal should be upfront, dry (minimal reverb), and heavily compressed. This gives it a punchy, aggressive, and intimate feel, making every syllable authoritative. In the chorus, the vocal should be doubled (or more) and treated with more reverb and delay, giving it the anthemic "canyon echo" quality that makes it feel huge.</li>
            <li><strong>Instrumental Production & Stereo Field:</strong> This is a "band in a room" aesthetic. The drums must be powerful and tight, with a sharp snare that cuts through. The bass and kick drum should be locked together, providing the relentless, driving pulse. Electric guitars should be panned wide across the stereo field to create an immersive, powerful wall of sound in the choruses, transforming a solo declaration into a collective, anthemic chant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>15) Intertextual & Historical Context</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Outlaw Anthem Lineage:</strong> This song is not a "protest song" in the political sense, but an "outlaw anthem". Its DNA traces directly to the anti-establishment rebellion of Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues," the defiant storytelling of Waylon Jennings' "Honky Tonk Heroes," and the hard-driving Southern rock of Steve Earle's "Copperhead Road". It celebrates the American mythological figure of the "lone wolf" rebel.</li>
            <li><strong>Socio-Political Climate:</strong> While not tied to a specific 2018-era event, this song taps into a timeless and potent American cultural value: rugged individualism and a deep suspicion of authority. It provides a fantasy of pure, unapologetic freedom from rules and serves as a counter-narrative to any rhetoric demanding conformity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>16) Audience Reception & Critical Response</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Critical Consensus:</strong> (Hypothetical) A song like this would be hailed by critics for its "lean, no-fat" songwriting. It's not reinventing the wheel; it's making a perfect wheel. It would be praised as a "fist-pumping highway anthem" and a "masterful execution of genre," celebrating its hooks, energy, and commitment to its outlaw premise.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance as Catharsis:</strong> In a live setting, this is a set-closer. The call-and-response of the "I'll be long gone" hook is a moment of powerful, collective catharsis and communal joy. The audience isn't just singing along; they are tapping into a shared, primal fantasy of escape and defiance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>17) Visual & Multimedia Integration</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aesthetic & Iconography:</strong> The music video must be a "neo-Western" car chase. A vintage muscle car (e.g., a '70 Dodge Charger) speeding down a sun-bleached desert highway. The color palette is not red, white, and blue, but rather the colors of the desert: faded denim, brown leather, rust, and turquoise, reclaiming and re-contextualizing the American landscape. The aesthetic is gritty, sweaty, and cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Narrative:</strong> The "choreography" is the car chase itself—fast cuts, tires kicking up dust, intercut with the band performing with a defiant, joyous energy in a dusty, roadside bar. The visuals celebrate this rebellious figure, positioning him not as an outsider but as the definition of freedom.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>18) Applied Songwriting Exercise: The "Avalanche" Method</h4>
        <p>This exercise adapts the framework's core techniques.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Part A: The Ironic Prosody Framework</strong>
                <p>The goal is to create tension by pairing a "stable" musical idea with an "unstable" lyrical idea.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose a simple, optimistic Major-key chord progression (e.g., I-IV-V - I, or G-C-D-G).</li>
                    <li>Write a lyric over this progression that describes a "losing" or "dark" situation (e.g., getting fired, going broke, a bad breakup).</li>
                    <li>Your goal is to make the character sound defiant or even thrilled about the disaster (e.g., singing "The bank just took my house today / Guess I'm finally free to get away / And I'll be long gone..." over that happy G-C-D progression).</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Part B: The "Outlaw Noun" Template (Adapted from the Manifesto Bridge)</strong>
                <p>This song builds its world from a perfect set of genre nouns. Practice this "world-building" technique.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose your genre/scenario (e.g., "Heartbreak Bar Song," "Hometown Nostalgia," "Protest Song").</li>
                    <li>The Setup: "I was taught that [Your Subject] was supposed to be about [The Ideal/The Promise]".</li>
                    <li>The Confrontation: "But until [Specific Noun #1] stops feeling like [Specific Injustice #1]...".</li>
                    <li>The Refrain: "This is not my [Subject]".</li>
                    <li>The Confrontation: "Until [Specific NN #2] feels safe for [Specific Group of People]...".</li>
                    <li>The Refrain: "This is not my [Subject]".</li>
                    <li>The Reclamation: "But it's going to be my [Subject] when we finally [A Call to Action]".</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
